# WeatherMapAPI

https://trepear.github.io/WeatherMapAPI/

This project's intent was to utilize a weather API to display the current weather, 5 day forecast, and UV index of city of the user's choice.

Additionally, as an added feature, different display messages will populate the page depending of that city's temperature.
